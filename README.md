# ⚡ TCP-KVDB

A lightweight TCP-based Key-Value database built in TypeScript. It supports basic commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DELETE`, and `LIST`, with automatic JSON file persistence.

Ideal for learning about TCP protocols, building low-level systems, or embedding into other tools via socket communication.
